"""
Mixing positional and keyword arguments

You can mix both fashions if you want - there is only one unbreakable rule
: you have to put positional arguments before keyword arguments.

If you think for a moment, you'll certainly guess why.

To show you how it works, we'll use the following simple three-parameter
function:
"""


def adding(a, b, c):
    print(a, "+", b, "+", c, "=", a + b + c)


"""
Its purpose is to evaluate and present the sum of all its arguments.

The function, when invoked in the following way:
"""

adding(1, 2, 3)

"""
will output:
1 + 2 + 3 = 6

It was - as you may suspect - a pure example of positional argument passing.

Of course, you can replace such an invocation with a purely keyword variant,
like this:
"""

adding(c=1, a=2, b=3)

"""
Our program will output a line like this:
2 + 3 + 1 = 6

Note the order of the values.

Let's try to mix both styles now.

Look at the function invocation below:
"""

adding(3, c=1, b=2)

"""
Let's analyze it:

    the argument (3) for the a parameter is passed using the positional way;
    the arguments for c and b are specified as keyword ones.

This is what you'll see in the console:
3 + 2 + 1 = 6

Be careful, and beware of mistakes. If you try to pass more than one value to
one argument, all you'll get is a runtime error.

Look at the invocation below - it seems that we've tried to set a twice:
"""

adding(3, a=1, b=2)

""""
Python's response:
TypeError: adding() got multiple values for argument 'a'

Look at the snipet below. A code like this is fully correct, but it doesn't
make much sense:
"""

adding(4, 3, c=2)

"""
Everything is right, but leaving in just one keyword argument looks a bit weird
- what do you think?
"""
