"""
Program that recognizes the largest among the entered numbers.
We'll convert it twice, using the break and continue instructions.

The break variant goes here:
"""
largestNumber = -99999999
counter = 0

while True:
    number = int(input("Enter a number or type -1 to end program: "))
    if number == -1:
        break
    counter += 1
    if number > largestNumber:
        largestNumber = number

if counter != 0:
    print("The largest number is", largestNumber)
else:
    print("You haven't entered any number.")

"""
And now the continue variant:
"""
largestNumber = -99999999
counter = 0

number = int(input("Enter a number or type -1 to end program: "))

while number != -1:
    if number == -1:
        continue
    counter += 1

    if number > largestNumber:
        largestNumber = number
    number = int(input("Enter a number or type -1 to end program: "))

if counter:
    print("The largest number is", largestNumber)
else:
    print("You haven't entered any number.")
