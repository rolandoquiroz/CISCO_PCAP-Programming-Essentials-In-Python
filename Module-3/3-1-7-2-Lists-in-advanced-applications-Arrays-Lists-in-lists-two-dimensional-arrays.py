Lists in lists: two-dimensional arrays

Let's also assume that a predefined symbol named EMPTY designates an empty
field on the chessboard.

So, if we want to create a list of lists representing the whole chessboard,
it may be done in the following way:

board = []

for i in range(8):
    row = [EMPTY for i in range(8)]
    board.append(row)

Note:

    the inner part of the loop creates a row consisting of eight elements
    (each of them equal to EMPTY) and appends it to the board list;
    the outer part repeats it eight times;
    in total, the board list consists of 64 elements (all equal to EMPTY)

This model perfectly mimics the real chessboard, which is in fact an
eight-element list of elements, all being single rows. Let's summarize
our observations:

    the elements of the rows are fields, eight of them per row;
    the elements of the chessboard are rows, eight of them per chessboard.

The board variable is now a two-dimensional array. It's also called, by
analogy to algebraic terms, a matrix.

As list comprehensions can be nested, we can shorten the board creation
in the following way:

board = [[EMPTY for i in range(8)] for j in range(8)]

The inner part creates a row, and the outer part builds a list of rows.

Access to the selected field of the board requires two indices - the
first selects the row; the second - the field number inside the row,
which is de facto a column number.

Take a look at the chessboard. Every field contains a pair of indices
which should be given to access the field's content:


Glancing at the figure shown above, let's set some chess pieces on the
board. First, let's add all the rooks:
board[0][0] = ROOK
board[0][7] = ROOK
board[7][0] = ROOK
board[7][7] = ROOK

If you want to add a knight to C4, you do it as follows:
board[4][2] = KNIGHT

And now a pawn to E5:
board[3][4] = PAWN

And now - experiment with the code in the editor.
